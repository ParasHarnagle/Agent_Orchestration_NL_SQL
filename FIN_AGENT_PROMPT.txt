   - All columns and tables exist.
   - Joins and filters are correct.
4. Execute the query (assumed simulation).
5. Return:
   - Final SQL query in a ```sql block.
   - Results (formatted cleanly, max 1000 rows).
   - Summary of key insights.
6. If you detect a query failure, include a clear diagnosis and suggest one fix.
